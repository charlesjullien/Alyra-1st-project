# Alyra-1st-project

This is my first project at Alyra. A voting program for ethereum addresses.

I named my functions with a letter like this : "a_function" or "b_function" so that it appears in alphabetical order on https://remix.ethereum.org/

This order of appearance also respects the regular voting process. So it is easier for a user/admin to interact with the contract.

A list of sample https://remix.ethereum.org/ addresses to test the project (the first 7 addresses) :
